# In-silico Modelling of the Deployment of Left Atrial Appendage Occluder Devices
## WELCOME!

Welcome! My name is Maria Sánchez, and I'm here to show you this work; a TFG project repository for "In-silico Modelling of the Deployment of Left Atrial Appendage Occluder Devices: A Sensitivity Analysis." This work, conducted by Marian Iglesias Blanco, a biomedical student from UPF, aims to provide valuable insights into the personalized preoperative planning of percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion interventions.

## Introduction

Percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion interventions have emerged as an alternative to oral anticoagulants for preventing cardioembolic strokes in atrial fibrillation patients. However, selecting the optimal device type, size, and position remains a challenging task. Complications such as device embolization, device-related thrombosis, and leaks can occur due to inadequate preoperative planning. To address this issue, computational tools can offer personalized insights into the interaction between occluder devices and the patient's LAA anatomy, minimizing deployment problems.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are as follows:

1. Develop a computational model to simulate the deployment of LAA occluder devices in patient-specific anatomies.
2. Investigate key factors in finite element modeling (FEM) to ensure a realistic interaction between occluder devices and LAA anatomy. This includes studying mesh discretization, material properties, and boundary conditions.
3. Perform a sensitivity analysis study using a geometrical model based on computed tomography (CT) images from a patient who underwent LAA occlusion at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain).
4. Utilize High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, including the Alya FEM solver developed by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, to handle the computational burden associated with simulations.
5. Derive meaningful conclusions regarding geometry characteristics, methodology, and material selection for accurate modeling of LAA occluder deployment.
6. Lay the groundwork for future developments, aiming to provide clinicians with a realistic device deployment option for enhanced pre-procedural planning.
